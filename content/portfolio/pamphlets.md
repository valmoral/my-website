In December 2017, I was approached by a co-worker at Powell Library to help design a series of pamphlets for the UCLA Libraries. The purpose of the pamphlets is for students to have a guide of the study spots available at each library, alongside features of said study spot. For 3 months, I worked alongside co-worker to create a personalized "Where to Study" pamphlet for 7 UCLA Libraries. We took inventory of the study spaces in each library, and utilized Canva to create the pamphlets while maintaining the colors and branding of the UCLA Library system.

Throughout those 3 months, we went through a series of revisions both in the design and content. After those 3 months of work, the project was initially shut down; however, when the new school year arrived, the project was revamped and the pamphlets were finalized and printed. The pamphlets are available at the entrance of each library.
