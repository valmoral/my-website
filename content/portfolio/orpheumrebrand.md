In winter 2020, I took my final Digital Humanities course, DH 199, a research based course under the umbrella topic of "Downtown Los Angeles Broadway Theaters." After delving into the rich history of these grandiose theaters, I decided to focus our final project on rebranding an entire theatre, the Orpheum, in the hopes of bringing life back to the theatre district in downtown LA.

We presented our final project to a few board members of the Historic Theatre Foundation. They loved the rebranding and praised us for focusing our project on marketing a theatre rather than the shows at the theater.
