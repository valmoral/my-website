I was given the task to update the content and functionality of the online student portal for the New York Film Academy. I recognized inefficiencies in UX/UI design and began to gather and analyze data to make informed decisions about the students' needs for the website. The following is my methodology:

* Gathered and analyzed user statistics such as total page views and unique visitor traffic 
* Analyzed other universities' student portals as case studies
* Sent out a 16 question survey and analyzed responses from 157 students across all 3 campuses
* Conducted 2 student focus groups and 1 staff focus group
* Prepared a 16-page website rebranding proposal in Adobe InDesign that included all of my research, a proposed site map, mockups, and an implementation plan

I presented the proposal to the President of NYFA and a committee made up of Deans from all three campus locations for approval into the next phase of implementation. Not only was it approved for the next phase, but it was also given praise for its attention to detail on the students needs and use of data to support the decisions made.

All in all, the proposed portal enhances student online capabilities, reduces missed classes, and increases efficiency for multiple departments that have new online capabilities (such as registration, tuition payments, permit bookings, equipment rentals, and appointments).
