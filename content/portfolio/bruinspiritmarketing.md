As a Digital Marketing Director for the Bruin Spirit Executive Committee in the Student Alumni Association, I assisted with marketing efforts for 2 of the largest spirit events at UCLA: the Beat 'SC Bonfire and I Heart UCLA Week. 

For the Beat 'SC Bonfire, I drafted the "Beat 'SC History" video that was viewed live by an audience of about 2000 and has been viewed over 3000 times on Facebook. For I Heart UCLA Week, I designed the Snapchat filter that was available to an audience of 45000+ for 1 week. I created the Snapchat filter again in 2019 for the centennial year.
