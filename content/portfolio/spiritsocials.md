In May 2018 I became a member of and Media Coordinator for the UCLA Spirit Squad. I led the rebranding of the Spirit Squad social media to follow our word of the year: warrior. The Instagram thus had a darker, fiercer feel with black as its primary color. I created templates in Adobe Photoshop for birthday, gameday, and miscellaneous marketing posts to follow the branding.

In May 2019 I was promoted to Media Marketing Director for the UCLA Spirit Squad. In conjunction with UCLA's 100th anniversary, I chose to rebrand the social media to utilize UCLA Blue as its primary color.

Instagram followers grew by 37% under my lead.
