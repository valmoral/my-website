![This is me][1]

*Â¡Hola! I'm Valeria but you can call me Val*

I am 100% Colombian (like the coffee) and am so proud to be part of what J. Balvin calls #LatinoGang. I was raised in sunny southern California, about 15 minutes from Disneyland, in a town called Anaheim Hills.

I am currently based in London, pursuing my Masters in Analytics and Management at **London Business School.** I have a Bachelor of Science in Statistics with a minor in Digital Humanities from **UCLA Honors College**. 

My time at UCLA was nothing short of incredible and gave me the chance to wear several different hats as a student and a leader in my community. I am now excited to create a global career in the tech industry and be an advocate for **women and latinas in STEM**. 

Apart from my studies, I love to dance and was lucky enough to live out my dreams of dancing for my university, as a member of the UCLA Dance Team. When I'm not in the kitchen crafting an intricate veggie bowl, you can find me listening to my playlists on Spotify or reading a novel. My other interests include live music, sustainability, and fashion.

I must give a special remark to my amazing parents, brother, and friends who have supported me in all of my endeavors. Lastly, thank YOU for visiting my page. I hope as you look through my site, you get a better understanding of my skills and passions.
