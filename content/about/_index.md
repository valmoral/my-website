![This is me][1]

*Â¡Hola! I'm Valeria but you can call me Val*

I am 100% Colombian (like the coffee) and am so proud to be part of what J. Balvin calls #LatinoGang. Though, I was raised in sunny southern California, about 15 minutes from Disneyland, in a town called Anaheim Hills.

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Analytics and Management from **London Business School.** I have a Bachelor of Science in Statistics with a minor in Digital Humanities from **UCLA** Honors College. My time at UCLA was nothing short of incredible and gave me the chance to wear several different hats as a student and a leader in my community. I am now excited to create a global career in the tech industry and be an advocate for **women and latinas in STEM**. 

I am a dancer and was lucky enough to live out my dreams of dancing for my university, cheering on the Bruins from Rose Bowl Field and Pauley Pavilion Court. When I'm not in the kitchen crafting an intricate veggie bowl, you can find me listening to my playlists on Spotify or reading fiction (with the occasional non-fiction). My other interests include cooking, live music, sustainability, and fashion. 

I must give a special remark to my amazing parents, brother, and friends who have supported me in all of my endeavors. Lastly, thank YOU for visiting my page. I hope as you look through my site, you get a better understanding of my skills and passions.
